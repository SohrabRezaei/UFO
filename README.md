# UFO_Challenge

## Overview of Project

It is requested that we modify the UFO sightings website that we already have, which filtered the data by clicking on a filter table button to create five input boxes to filter the data based on date, city, state, country, and shape by noticing the change of the text in the input boxes without clicking a button.

## Results

In the beginning, our original unfiltered table looks like the following image.[![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/59YYRKyx/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/Thx3y9nS). Then, we choose one of the input boxes such as 'Enter a City' and write el cajon in order to filter the table based on that city.

## Summary

One possible drawback could be utilizing a change event might be confusing for the user, whereas by creating a button, the user knows that by clicking the specific button, the whole table is going to get filtered.
